- `docker` and `docker-compose`

### Before you start

- use `.env.example` to make `.env` files for both root folder and `/server`

### Backend

`dev.sh` acts as your good old `docker-compose` command for example:

```sh
$ ./dev.sh up # Start dev server and anything
$ ./dev.sh exec backend sh # Run shell inside backend container for debugging and stuff
```

#### Ports

Port `6869` is exposed for `backend` container for both API and graphql-playground  
Port `4466` is exposed for `prisma` container also for graphql-playground

### Frontend

#### Starting dev server

```sh
$ yarn # install dependencies
$ yarn start # start development server
```

### Graphql Playground

make sure you have installed all dependecies for backend

```sh
$ sh scripts/playground.sh # or simply
$ scripts/playground.sh
```

backend endpoints can be configured in `client/src/enviroments`
